# Syntax.

A tasty treats podcast for Web Developers.

This is the site that runs [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm) â€” go there to listen to it!

This site is built on React and Next.js

## Requirements
- Node 8.1.2 or higher

## Development

First you `npm install`

Then you `npm run dev` and visit `http://localhost:6969`.

Then you do some work.

When you are ready for prime time, you can just submit a PR to this repo and it will be deployed once it's accepted.

If you want to build your own version, just run `npm run build` and then I'd recommend deploying with `now`.


<!--
notes: 
- since there is a compile step no matter what we static render dynamically and compile/deploy the renderer instead of its output
- the whole getInitialProps thing was pretty confusing userland boilerplate 
- not sure if config is better or worse now!
- better sep of concerns and more portable for sure
- needs a 404 page
- added tests
- removed webpack/babel and replaced with rollup/typescript
- removed proptypes and used typescript interfaces instead (functioncs components don't need this)
